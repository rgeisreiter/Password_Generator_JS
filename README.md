# Password_Generator_JS

# Description The whole goal behind this project, via the instructions was to create a webpage that, when fully functioning, would generate a password given the users specified criteria. The user is able to input five different sections of criteria for the generator to work with. The different sections are how long the user wants the password to be, whether they want upper and lower case letter values, and finally whether they wanted numbers or special characters in their randomly generated password. Additionally, the generator has requirements that at least one sectiion of criteria must be selected, and if not, it would tell the user that it must do so. Throughout this project, I learned how to utilize javascript much more proficiently than I had previously.

# Usage The website is pretty self explanatory. When the user comes to the website, and they click on the "generate password" button, they are shown a series of prompts on how they want their password to be constructed. After they follow all of these prompts, they are given a random password in the box.
